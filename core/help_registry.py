     "1. **Enrichment pass**: The AI rewrites every lecture narration to be richer, "
     "more detailed, and truly educational with real examples and step-by-step explanations\n"
     "2. **Decomposition pass**: After N enrichments, courses are automatically split "
     "into deeper sub-courses for more granular learning\n"
     "3. **Jargon pass**: Specialized terminology courses are generated to master "
     "field-specific vocabulary\n"
     "4. **Level advancement**: After M decompositions, the education level advances "
     "to provide more sophisticated content\n\n"
     "**Versioning:**\n"
     "Every enrichment creates a new version — prior narration is never lost. You can "
     "review how lectures evolved over successive enrichment passes.\n\n"
     "**Settings:**\n"
     "- **Enrichments before decompose**: How many enrichment cycles before triggering "
     "a course decomposition (default: 3)\n"
     "- **Decompositions before level advance**: How many decompositions before "
     "advancing the education level (default: 2)\n"
     "- **Jargon per cycle**: How many jargon sub-courses to generate per decomposition "
     "cycle (default: 1)\n"
     "- **Rate limit**: Seconds to wait between LLM calls to avoid rate limiting "
     "(default: 2.0)\n"
     "- **Auto-render**: Automatically render video lectures after each enrichment cycle\n\n"
     "**Usage:**\n"
     "Go to Batch Render → 24/7 Continuous Enrichment section. Select a target course "
